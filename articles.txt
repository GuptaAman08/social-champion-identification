The Christian Science Monitor interviewed experts to discuss five ways to prevent future mass shootings such as the tragic incident this month at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, Calif.Experts recommended having people register to buy a gun before getting one, doing more gun violence prevention studies, enlisting more citizen defenders, and having law enforcement do threat assessments.Meanwhile, National Association of Social Workers member Ron Avi Astor, DSW, a social work professor at the University of Southern California, also recommended media talk more about the victims, their contributions to society, and how their loss has affected others.That is because articles that focus on the perpetrators can spur a "contagion effect” that spurs potential mass shooters to commit similar crimes to live up to their "heroes” or gain notoriety."I'm like everybody else, I want to know who the person is, who his wife was, why they did it – that's human nature,” Astor said. "But focusing intently on victims and what was lost here in a meaningless and random way … sends a really clear message that the sanctity of human life is so high that it's unacceptable to shoot somebody as a way to send a message.”Read the National Association of Social Workers California Chapter statement on the San Bernardino shooting to learn ways social workers can help prevent such crimes.

Social work has evolved from originally working solely with people in poverty to government programming, counseling and health-related services, University of Texas at Austin clinical assistant professor Cossy Hough said.However, in this Fort Worth Star-Telegram op-ed Hough predicted that social work will move even more into the corporate world.This is because more companies are interested in using social workers to interact with the communities they serve and improve interactions among employees. For example, Motorola and 3M have already hired social workers for their employee assistance programs, she wrote."Social workers can also play a vital role in the establishment of the structure and policy of an organization,” Hough wrote. "Because social workers are trained in interconnectivity and the systems operating in people's lives, they bring new perspectives on organization management.”To learn about the positive role social workers play in society visit the National Association of Social Workers' "Help Starts Here” consumer website.
National Association of Social Workers senior consultant Joan Zlotnik said in this USA Today/Burlington Free Press article there is growing anger in United States over child abuse fatalities but many people do not understand how complex and difficult child protective services work can be.The comments from Zlotnik, PhD, ACSW, came almost a week after the shooting death of social worker Lara Sobel, MSW, by the mother of girl put in protective custody. The woman also murdered three family members.The tragedy has put greater attention on the challenges and dangers such employees experience.Zlotnik said in Vermont and other states social service workers are not required to have a social work degree. Proper education and training can mean the difference between life and death for a child, said NASW member Katharine Briar-Lawson, a social welfare professor at the University of Albany in New York who was also interviewed in the article."It's a very hard job and minimized nationally,” Zlotnik said. "The thought is it's something anyone can do.”Other studies have said child protection caseworker should have lower caseloads and Vermont Department of Children and Families Commissioner Ken Schatz and Gov. Shumlin  said there should be more positive communication about the important role of child protection workers."The dialogue has digressed to the point where we must all answer it and we can no longer be silent,” the governor said.

National Association of Social Workers (NASW) CEO Angelo McClain said Monday during an interview on National Public Radio Vermont that there should be a National Social Worker Safety Act to help protect social workers from violence.The national law should be modeled after a Massachusetts law passed in 2013 that followed the recommendations of the NASW Massachusetts Chapter, McClain, PhD, LICSW said.That law requires programs that provide direct services to clients that are operated by, licensed, certified, or funded by a department or division of the Massachusetts Executive Office of Health and Human Services have a workplace violence prevention and crisis response plan.NPR interviewed McClain and others in the aftermath of the August 7 shooting death of Vermont Department for Children and Families employee Lara Sobel. Sobel was allegedly shot by a woman whose daughter was taken from her custody. The shooter also reportedly killed three family members.McClain, citing some tips outlined in NASW's Guidelines for Social Worker Safety in the Workplace, said having two social workers go out on home visits or installing panic buttons so social workers can alert police, are ways to lessen the chance social workers and other social service employees will be injured.Social service employees and even students in social work schools should also get training on what to do in a violent situation or how to defuse situations before they escalate, he said."There is a lot of danger in the job but most of the families we worked with we were able to engage with them,” said McClain, who was a caseworker and former commissioner for the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families.  "As you have those skills, the families can see you are trying to help and not judge them and put them down.”For more information on this issue visit the NASW Social Work Safety website.

Former Spokane, Wash. NAACP President Rachel Dolezal, a white woman who passed as black, has damaged the African American community she pledged to serve, former NASW President Gary Bailey said in a recent Huffington Post column."The issue at hand is that a white person who is pretending to be black, and is running a branch of the NAACP is indeed the problem,” Bailey wrote. "Of more concern is Ms. Dolezal's lack of honesty and integrity, and the collateral damage she has done to the community she claims to want to be a part of.”And although Dolezal had sympathy and compassion for the black community, Bailey said she would never have suffered the indignity experienced by black teenager Dajerria Becton, who was violently arrested by a white police officer at at McKinney, Texas pool party."No way, no how. And that is the major difference between a truly lived experience and the co-option of a people's experience,” Bailey, MSW, ACSW, said.The National Association of Social Workers (NASW)  is committed to equal treatment for all, including people of color.

President Obama's April 9 statement supporting state-level bans on so-called reparative or conversation therapy for youth was a good step, past National Association of Social Workers (NASW) President Jeane Anastas said in this column on The Conversation website.However, the federal government should go further by enacting sweeping protections for people who are LGBT that cover the entire nation, Anastas said."Banning harmful mental health treatments is a positive step forward, but providing federal civil rights protections that would cover all 50 states is needed for a society in which LGBTQ people of all ages can flourish,” Anastas, PhD, ACSW, wrote.NASW has been against sexual orientation change efforts (or SOCE) for 20 years, Anastas said. The practices are ineffective and can damage the mental well being of people who undergo them, she said.Eighteen states are considering bans that Obama is calling for, Anastas said. However, she worries that if the measures past it could lead to an unequal playing field similar to the legalization of gay marriage, which is legal in some states but not others.Here is NASW's statement on reparative or conversation therapies for people who are gay or lesbian. Social workers are also committed to equal treatment for all, considering people from the LGBT community. To learn more visit NASW's Diversity and Equity website.

So you unhappy about being alone on the holidays. How do you get through it?U.S. News and World Report reporter Laura McMullen interviewed LeslieBeth Wish, a relationship expert for the National Association of Social Workers, and others for advice for this article.Wish said people who do not want to be alone should acknowledge their sadness and not try to cover it with false frivolity.

Mass killings involving four families in four states over four days prompted Associated Press reporter to write an article that tried to explain why such horrendous acts occur.National Association of Social Workers expert and Howard University Professor Tricia Bent-Goodley, and other experts said such crimes are more common than you think. Bent-Goodley is author of the "The Ultimate Betrayal: A Renewed Look at Intimate Partner Violence” (NASW Press, $33.99).Bent-Goodley said nine women a day are killed by an intimate partner. So Bent-Goodley said the slayings in Phoenix, New York City, Texas and South Carolina  "are a reminder that the home is not a safe place for all Americans and that people do the unthinkable each day against people they say they love.”Meanwhile, social health scholar and psychotherapist Elena Mustakova-Possardt said one way to lessen the frequency of such crime is to find ways to keep people connected to their family and communities. People who commit such crimes are often socially isolated and have come to hate themselves and their communities, she said.Social workers help clients overcome life's adversities, including trauma and mental illness.

Grief is usually all consuming at first but gradually people who have lost a loved one begin to move on with life.However, for people who suffer from complicated grief the mourning phase continues and even worsens, with some becoming socially isolated and refusing to accept the death of a loved one.There is hope, according to Katherine Shear, MD, director of the Center for Complicated Grief at the Columbia University School of Social Work in New York City.Shear, who was interviewed in this Parade article, has developed a 16-session psychotherapy intervention that lets people who are grieving go back to the moment when they learned a loved one died. They can then work through issues surrounding the death. For instance, Stephanie Muldberg grieved for years after losing her 13-year-old son, Eric, to bone cancer in 2004. When she accepted psychotherapy Muldberg tackled emotions that had kept her in deep grief."I told Eric I was sad and angry that he suffered so much from bone surgery late in his treatment,” Muldberg told Parade.With the help of therapy Muldberg said she is now able to remember the joy her son brought. She said she is ready to move back into life.Social workers help clients overcome grief. To learn more visit the National Association of Social Workers' Grief and Loss website.   
Figuring out whether your child's caregiver is abusing them is difficult because the signs often do not begin until after abuse has already begun, social worker Erin Strohbehn told KMOV TV in St. Louis.The TV station interviewed Strohbehn after Anna Bahr, 22, was given five years probation for breaking the leg of a 16-month-old child in her care. Bahr also can no longer babysit children.Parents should be concerned if a caregiver is not excited, engaged and happy to be with their baby, Strohbehn said. They should worry if the person constantly speaks negatively about their child, she said.And parents should look out for bruises and cuts in places other than where children usually fall and have scraps, such as the elbows and knees, Strohbehn said.Social workers help children and their parents overcome life's challenges.

Gothamist reporter Sabine Heinlein and her husband had two elderly, female cousins as neighbors who kept a house full of cats and dogs.But they never let the animals outdoors and when the neighbors opened their windows the stench of dog and cat feces and urine could be smelled in Heinlein's nearby home.Heinlein wrote about the years long push to get these neighbors to surrender their pets and clean their property, an effort that is ongoing.For her article she interviewed National Association of Social Workers' expert Mark Gaynor, MSW, ACSW, a therapist could has helped clients address hoarding problems. Gaynor also appeared on the Animal Planet reality program "Confessions: Animal Hoarding.”Gaynor said the Heinlein's neighbors fit the typical description of hoarders."The majority are single women over the age of 60 who have had a series of traumas in their lives,” he said. "They are not able to make healthy relationships with the world around them and probably had some earlier life experiences in which they were highly rewarded by animals. Animals are soothing to them.”
Americans spend about $10 billion a year on psychological services.But are they really asking the right questions to get the best possible mental healthcare?Quentin Fottrell, a reporter for the Wall Street Journal's MarketWatch, talked to mental health professionals to find out what consumers should know when picking a licensed clinical social worker, psychiatrist or psychologist. The experts' tips were included in Fottrell's news article.For instance, clients and mental healthcare providers should set clear treatment goals so therapy does not go on indefinitely, said Mirean Coleman, a clinical social worker and senior practice associate with the National Association of Social Workers.National Association of Social Workers member Julie Hanks said consumers should make sure they are working with an educated and licensed professional. For instance people who do life coaching, or helping clients attain professional or personal goals, do not necessarily have to be licensed social workers, psychiatrists or psychologists.And although its an important to find a qualified therapist a degree does not always guarantee good service, Hanks said."What it boils down to is the quality of the connection between the client and therapist,” she said.Social workers are some of the leading providers of mental healthcare in the United States and help clients overcome depression, eating disorders and other mental illnesses.

You cannot address a problem if you do not admit it exists, she said.Wish also advises reconnecting with faraway family and friends through letters and avoiding alcohol to drown your sorrows because that could lead to worse problems, like getting sick or fighting.Lastly, Wish said it is unwise to rush into a relationship or sexual tryst to cover loneliness."When your desperation meter is running, you don't read people accurately,” she said.

Mass killings involving four families in four states over four days prompted Associated Press reporter to write an article that tried to explain why such horrendous acts occur.National Association of Social Workers expert and Howard University Professor Tricia Bent-Goodley, and other experts said such crimes are more common than you think. Bent-Goodley is author of the "The Ultimate Betrayal: A Renewed Look at Intimate Partner Violence” (NASW Press, $33.99).Bent-Goodley said nine women a day are killed by an intimate partner. So Bent-Goodley said the slayings in Phoenix, New York City, Texas and South Carolina  "are a reminder that the home is not a safe place for all Americans and that people do the unthinkable each day against people they say they love.”Meanwhile, social health scholar and psychotherapist Elena Mustakova-Possardt said one way to lessen the frequency of such crime is to find ways to keep people connected to their family and communities. People who commit such crimes are often socially isolated and have come to hate themselves and their communities, she said.Social workers help clients overcome life's adversities, including trauma and mental illness.

Grief is usually all consuming at first but gradually people who have lost a loved one begin to move on with life.However, for people who suffer from complicated grief the mourning phase continues and even worsens, with some becoming socially isolated and refusing to accept the death of a loved one.There is hope, according to Katherine Shear, MD, director of the Center for Complicated Grief at the Columbia University School of Social Work in New York City.Shear, who was interviewed in this Parade article, has developed a 16-session psychotherapy intervention that lets people who are grieving go back to the moment when they learned a loved one died. They can then work through issues surrounding the death. For instance, Stephanie Muldberg grieved for years after losing her 13-year-old son, Eric, to bone cancer in 2004. When she accepted psychotherapy Muldberg tackled emotions that had kept her in deep grief."I told Eric I was sad and angry that he suffered so much from bone surgery late in his treatment,” Muldberg told Parade.With the help of therapy Muldberg said she is now able to remember the joy her son brought. She said she is ready to move back into life.Social workers help clients overcome grief. To learn more visit the National Association of Social Workers' Grief and Loss website.   
Figuring out whether your child's caregiver is abusing them is difficult because the signs often do not begin until after abuse has already begun, social worker Erin Strohbehn told KMOV TV in St. Louis.The TV station interviewed Strohbehn after Anna Bahr, 22, was given five years probation for breaking the leg of a 16-month-old child in her care. Bahr also can no longer babysit children.Parents should be concerned if a caregiver is not excited, engaged and happy to be with their baby, Strohbehn said. They should worry if the person constantly speaks negatively about their child, she said.And parents should look out for bruises and cuts in places other than where children usually fall and have scraps, such as the elbows and knees, Strohbehn said.Social workers help children and their parents overcome life's challenges.

Animals are soothing to them.”
Americans spend about $10 billion a year on psychological services.But are they really asking the right questions to get the best possible mental healthcare?Quentin Fottrell, a reporter for the Wall Street Journal's MarketWatch, talked to mental health professionals to find out what consumers should know when picking a licensed clinical social worker, psychiatrist or psychologist. The experts' tips were included in Fottrell's news article.For instance, clients and mental healthcare providers should set clear treatment goals so therapy does not go on indefinitely, said Mirean Coleman, a clinical social worker and senior practice associate with the National Association of Social Workers.National Association of Social Workers member Julie Hanks said consumers should make sure they are working with an educated and licensed professional. For instance people who do life coaching, or helping clients attain professional or personal goals, do not necessarily have to be licensed social workers, psychiatrists or psychologists.And although its an important to find a qualified therapist a degree does not always guarantee good service, Hanks said."What it boils down to is the quality of the connection between the client and therapist,” she said.Social workers are some of the leading providers of mental healthcare in the United States and help clients overcome depression, eating disorders and other mental illnesses.

The Christian Science Monitor interviewed experts to discuss five ways to prevent future mass shootings such as the tragic incident this month at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, Calif.Experts recommended having people register to buy a gun before getting one, doing more gun violence prevention studies, enlisting more citizen defenders, and having law enforcement do threat assessments.Meanwhile, National Association of Social Workers member Ron Avi Astor, DSW, a social work professor at the University of Southern California, also recommended media talk more about the victims, their contributions to society, and how their loss has affected others.That is because articles that focus on the perpetrators can spur a "contagion effect” that spurs potential mass shooters to commit similar crimes to live up to their "heroes” or gain notoriety."I'm like everybody else, I want to know who the person is, who his wife was, why they did it – that's human nature,” Astor said. "But focusing intently on victims and what was lost here in a meaningless and random way … sends a really clear message that the sanctity of human life is so high that it's unacceptable to shoot somebody as a way to send a message.”Read the National Association of Social Workers California Chapter statement on the San Bernardino shooting to learn ways social workers can help prevent such crimes. NASW also has a statement on how society can address gun violence, mental illness and racism.
Social work has evolved from originally working solely with people in poverty to government programming, counseling and health-related services, University of Texas at Austin clinical assistant professor Cossy Hough said.However, in this Fort Worth Star-Telegram op-ed Hough predicted that social work will move even more into the corporate world.This is because more companies are interested in using social workers to interact with the communities they serve and improve interactions among employees. For example, Motorola and 3M have already hired social workers for their employee assistance programs, she wrote."Social workers can also play a vital role in the establishment of the structure and policy of an organization,” Hough wrote. "Because social workers are trained in interconnectivity and the systems operating in people's lives, they bring new perspectives on organization management.”To learn about the positive role social workers play in society visit the National Association of Social Workers' "Help Starts Here” consumer website.
National Association of Social Workers senior consultant Joan Zlotnik said in this USA Today/Burlington Free Press article there is growing anger in United States over child abuse fatalities but many people do not understand how complex and difficult child protective services work can be.The comments from Zlotnik, PhD, ACSW, came almost a week after the shooting death of social worker Lara Sobel, MSW, by the mother of girl put in protective custody. The woman also murdered three family members.The tragedy has put greater attention on the challenges and dangers such employees experience.Zlotnik said in Vermont and other states social service workers are not required to have a social work degree. Proper education and training can mean the difference between life and death for a child, said NASW member Katharine Briar-Lawson, a social welfare professor at the University of Albany in New York who was also interviewed in the article."It's a very hard job and minimized nationally,” Zlotnik said. "The thought is it's something anyone can do.”Other studies have said child protection caseworker should have lower caseloads and Vermont Department of Children and Families Commissioner Ken Schatz and Gov. Shumlin  said there should be more positive communication about the important role of child protection workers."The dialogue has digressed to the point where we must all answer it and we can no longer be silent,” the governor said. "Hateful speech leads to hateful acts.”Social workers help families overcome life's challenges.

National Association of Social Workers (NASW) CEO Angelo McClain said Monday during an interview on National Public Radio Vermont that there should be a National Social Worker Safety Act to help protect social workers from violence.The national law should be modeled after a Massachusetts law passed in 2013 that followed the recommendations of the NASW Massachusetts Chapter, McClain, PhD, LICSW said.That law requires programs that provide direct services to clients that are operated by, licensed, certified, or funded by a department or division of the Massachusetts Executive Office of Health and Human Services have a workplace violence prevention and crisis response plan.NPR interviewed McClain and others in the aftermath of the August 7 shooting death of Vermont Department for Children and Families employee Lara Sobel. Sobel was allegedly shot by a woman whose daughter was taken from her custody. The shooter also reportedly killed three family members.McClain, citing some tips outlined in NASW's Guidelines for Social Worker Safety in the Workplace, said having two social workers go out on home visits or installing panic buttons so social workers can alert police, are ways to lessen the chance social workers and other social service employees will be injured.Social service employees and even students in social work schools should also get training on what to do in a violent situation or how to defuse situations before they escalate, he said."There is a lot of danger in the job but most of the families we worked with we were able to engage with them,” said McClain, who was a caseworker and former commissioner for the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families.  "As you have those skills, the families can see you are trying to help and not judge them and put them down.”For more information on this issue visit the NASW Social Work Safety website.

Former Spokane, Wash. NAACP President Rachel Dolezal, a white woman who passed as black, has damaged the African American community she pledged to serve, former NASW President Gary Bailey said in a recent Huffington Post column."The issue at hand is that a white person who is pretending to be black, and is running a branch of the NAACP is indeed the problem,” Bailey wrote. "Of more concern is Ms. Dolezal's lack of honesty and integrity, and the collateral damage she has done to the community she claims to want to be a part of.”And although Dolezal had sympathy and compassion for the black community, Bailey said she would never have suffered the indignity experienced by black teenager Dajerria Becton, who was violently arrested by a white police officer at at McKinney, Texas pool party."No way, no how. And that is the major difference between a truly lived experience and the co-option of a people's experience,” Bailey, MSW, ACSW, said.The National Association of Social Workers (NASW)  is committed to equal treatment for all, including people of color.

President Obama's April 9 statement supporting state-level bans on so-called reparative or conversation therapy for youth was a good step, past National Association of Social Workers (NASW) President Jeane Anastas said in this column on The Conversation website.However, the federal government should go further by enacting sweeping protections for people who are LGBT that cover the entire nation, Anastas said."Banning harmful mental health treatments is a positive step forward, but providing federal civil rights protections that would cover all 50 states is needed for a society in which LGBTQ people of all ages can flourish,” Anastas, PhD, ACSW, wrote.NASW has been against sexual orientation change efforts (or SOCE) for 20 years, Anastas said. The practices are ineffective and can damage the mental well being of people who undergo them, she said.Eighteen states are considering bans that Obama is calling for, Anastas said. However, she worries that if the measures past it could lead to an unequal playing field similar to the legalization of gay marriage, which is legal in some states but not others.Here is NASW's statement on reparative or conversation therapies for people who are gay or lesbian. Social workers are also committed to equal treatment for all, considering people from the LGBT community. To learn more visit NASW's Diversity and Equity website.

The influence of family has a big impact on whether people suffering from anorexia nervosa recover from the eating disorder, according to this article on Healthline News."An individual is intrinsically part of a family system,” said NASW expert Maria Baratta, PhD, LCSW, who runs a private practice in New York City and is author of  "Skinny Revisited: Rethinking Anorexia Nervosa and It's Treatment” (NASW Press)."Therefore, in treating a person with anorexia, it is imperative to understand what part family members play in the disordered eating environment,” Baratta said.However if the family dynamic is toxic Baratta advised not having family members involved in treatment because it could put additional stress on the patient.To learn more about how social workers help clients overcome mental illness visit the National Association of Social Workers' "Help Starts Here” Mind and Spirit website.
