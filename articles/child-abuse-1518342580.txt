Story highlights Doctor is detained by ICE after 18 encounters with police, agency says
Family is fighting to get him freed
(CNN) A Michigan doctor came under scrutiny from immigration authorities due to 18 police encounters, including a child abuse allegation, an official with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement told CNN -- but those claims were investigated by police and weren't substantiated.
Dr. Lukasz R. Niec has been in ICE custody since last week. He is a permanent resident, his family says. But he could be deported to Poland -- a country he's never known. Niec's family has launched a legal fight to keep him in the US and bring him home.
His lawyer, Russell Abrutyn, said about the abuse allegation: "From what I understand, the Michigan State Police investigated this allegation and found it to be without merit. We expect the child abuse investigation to be dismissed, too."
Michigan State Police confirm they did investigate an allegation of child abuse against Niec in 2017 and turned their findings over to the county prosecutor's office.
A charging request form filed with the Kalamazoo County prosecuting attorney says police found "insufficient evidence" and determined there was "no reasonable likelihood of conviction."
