Leaving on a jet plane tomorrow at 6am.So excited for our first adult only Disney trip.Everyone thinks I'm a mean mom but thankfully my son wants nothing to do with Disney and is more excited to be hanging out with family this week.Headed to the yoga studio for 3rd day in a row---go me!Once again proof that if I try to talk myself out of class it's all anxiety in my head and I end up having a great session.I even decided to sign up for the October challenge to do 20 classes. Since I'm missing a week I will have to do some doubles when I get back but I really only made it a personal goal to get back into 3 classes a week. So as always 20 is just a number....All summer long I've ebbed around 1-2 a week so want to stop making excuses and do 3 more regularly.Work is work of course. I like my new interns but I also think the honeymoon period is ending with them too.I will address the issues I'm beginning to see when I get back.Being on vacation will either exacerbate things or give them the opportunity to shine.What are your plans for this fall?Have a relaxing rest of your weekend everyone!
I finally went back to yoga yesterday after a month long break.This seems like a year or more in reality.I actually ended up having a really amazing class.I got into every posture and took no breaks.This is so rare even when I am keeping up a regular practice.Getting back was just the motivation I needed and I can't wait to go back to class later today.With the crisper mornings and the busy summer winding down, I welcome the happy place of my yoga studio once again.Have you been struggling to stay motivated with something you typically enjoy?I encourage you to just go ahead and do it and guarantee you won't regret it!
Hey there old friends.I've been realizing that it's been months since I've checked in.I guess I have no excuses and along with that not much to say except life has been lazy lately....butin a good way.Enjoying the summer, enjoying the job...as cliche as it sounds sometimes no news is really good news.I'm off for the next couple of days for a staycation.I already think I need a rest.Attended a block party last night and I'm up early this morning to head upstate for the day to a party.I also am planning on giving in my final payment for Disney tomorrow.October is right around the corner.  A year really flies by quickly when you are busy adulting all day.What have you been up to old friend?
My son is home sick today so I have some time to catch up on my blog posts.We had a FANTASTIC vacation on our cruise and I highly recommend if you are looking to get away and do something that covers a little bit of everything.Also it makes for some interesting people watching and if you have any troubles in your life, they will probably seem a heck of a lot less once you meet some of those who frequent the bar areas on cruise ships ;). We have stories to share and my husband has friended some on Facebook and talk about lives of train wrecks....I've gotten back into the swing of things at work already (like I never left lol).This actually has been the first vacation I've come back from in awhile where I feel refreshed and not down and depressed like I usually do.The fact that we vacationed in the spring and have the whole summer to look forward to I think plays a big part in this.Plus by the last two days of our cruise, I was starting to go a little stir-crazy and wanted to get back to normal life.My students are winding down and only have a couple of weeks left to go.Having so many of them at once has been a huge stressor this year.I've decided I'm only going to take on two in the fall and I also am only going to work with schools that I'm getting stuff out of (I.e. Realistic CEUs, one even gives you an "adjunct professor" title after working with them for 3 years).Haven't been to the yoga studio since before vacation but that's okay.I will get back into it when life slows down a little.I've been trying to do some yoga at home and I've also been trying to get out and take a nice long walk most evenings.Right now I'm looking forward to planning some long weekend getaways in the summer and of course Disney in October.What are you looking forward to this spring/summer?Any suggestions for local mini-vacation getaways, especially if you are in the MetroNY area?
I don't think anyone reads my blog, but I just felt the need to shout to the universe that I only have one more work week until we leave for our cruise!I'm so excited.I packed the majority of our stuff this weekend.Probably way too much but narrowed it down to a bag per person, plus one bag with all of our toiletries, odds and ends and OTC stuff "just in case" someone gets sick or an allergic reaction (this happened to my husband on our last cruise when he went snorkeling and had a reaction to the tropical fish).It's been a stressful year for a variety of reasons, so even though we vacationed back in August, I feel like this trip has been a lonnnnnnnnnnnnnng time coming.Plus it's NOT Disney lol......so right there the trip will instantly be much more relaxing.I decided that even though I rarely get them for a bunch of reasons, I'm going to treat myself to a pedicure this coming weekend to celebrate being on vacation and all that is good in life.Speaking of good in life....I made it to hot yoga 3 days in a row this weekend.So fabulous.I also hear the ship offers a "sunrise stretch" so I may check this out and even look into some of their paid yoga classes.Do you have a vacation coming up?Or even just a staycation to treat yourself?
and returning to work, especially on a freezing cold day is always a challenge.Snow days.At least I only have 18 more to go until we leave for our vacation and 201 until I'm in Disney again.Also thinking ahead to our next big adventure.....maybe the Panama Canal cruise.Has anyone been?What day is it? Wednesday? I think we got this.
I think I was glutened at dinner last night because my stomach has been killing me this morning.I almost want to call into work, but I have a new client starting, and a school visiting.I officially joined Weight Watchers this weekend and downloaded the app. Currently in the negative in my weekly points from dinner alone last night.  Oops!On the plus I made it to yoga both days over the weekend.And a morning class yesterday which I never do.It sucked in the beginning but I ended up having an amazing class and of course didn't regret going at all.In the wise words of my yoga instructor, you can't think about it, just do it!This is going to be my motto for the week ahead.....
